4. Additional Insights:
-----------------------

Number of models with significant improvement: 2
Model with best improvement: Logistic Regression+LDA (14.89%) (Significant: Yes)

Overall Recommendation:
Including product type information appears beneficial for LDA-based storage condition classification.

5. LDA-specific Insights:
-----------------------
- LDA reduces the high-dimensional spectral data to a lower-dimensional space defined by the discriminant functions.
- The first discriminant function captures the most variance between storage condition classes.
- The LDA projection visualizations show how well the storage conditions are separated in the lower-dimensional space.
- The feature importance analysis reveals which spectral features are most discriminative for storage condition classification.
