4. Additional Insights:
-----------------------

Number of models with significant improvement: 0
Model with best improvement: LDA (1.47%) (Significant: No)

Overall Recommendation:
Storage condition information does not significantly improve LDA-based product type classification.
Consider using SVM+LDA without storage condition for simplicity and generalization.

5. LDA-specific Insights:
-----------------------
- LDA reduces the high-dimensional spectral data to a lower-dimensional space defined by the discriminant functions.
- The first discriminant function captures the most variance between classes.
- The LDA projection visualizations show how well the classes are separated in the lower-dimensional space.
- The feature importance analysis reveals which spectral features are most discriminative for product type classification.
